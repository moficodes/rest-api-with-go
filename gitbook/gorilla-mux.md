# Gorilla Mux

`net/http` built in methods are great. We can write a server with no external libraries. But `net/http` has its limitations. There is no direct way to handle path parameters. Just like request methods we have to handle path and query parameters manually. 

Gorilla Mux is a very popular library that works really well to net/http package and helps us do a few things that makes api building a breeze.
