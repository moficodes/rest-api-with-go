# Bookdata API

In Kaggle there is a dataset for bookdata. Its a csv file with about 13000 books. We will use it to make our own bookdata api.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/books.csv" %}

You can look at the file ☝🏼 there.

But let's get started.

In a separate folder

```text
git clone https://github.com/moficodes/bookdata-api.git
