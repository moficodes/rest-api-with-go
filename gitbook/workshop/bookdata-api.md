# Bookdata API

In Kaggle there is a dataset for bookdata. Its a csv file with about 13000 books. We will use it to make our own bookdata api.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/books.csv" %}

You can look at the file ‚òùüèº there.

### Clone Repo

Let's get started.

In a separate folder

```text
git clone https://github.com/moficodes/bookdata-api.git
```

### Tour of the Code

There are two packages inside the code. One is called datastore, one is called loader.

Loader deals with converting the `csv` data into an array of bookdata objects.

Datastore deals with how we access the data. It's mainly an interface that has some methods. 

### EndPoints

The App has a few Endpoints

```text
Get Books by Author
"/books/authors/{author}" 
Optional query parameter for ratingAbove ratingBelow limit and skip

Get Books by BookName
"/books/book-name/{bookName}"
Optional query parameter for ratingAbove ratingBelow limit and skip


Get Book by ISBN
"/book/isbn/{isbn}"

Delete Book by ISBN
"/book/isbn/{isbn}"

Create New Book
"/book"
```



### Deploy app to cloud

This step is completely optional. But if you want to run you go app in the cloud somewhere IBM Cloud has an excellent paas solution using Cloud Foundry.

* Install[ IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli#shell_install)

Once you have an IBM Cloud account and the IBM Cloud CLI installed,

From terminal

```text
ibmcloud login
```

```text
ibmcloud target --cf
```

Open the `manifest.yaml` in the root of the cloned repository.

Change the app name to something you like. After the change the file should look something like this

```text
---
applications:
- name: <your-app-name>
  random-route: true
  memory: 256M
  env:
    GOVERSION: go1.12
    GOPACKAGENAME: bookdata-api
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack.git
```

Then from the root of the repo run

```text
ibmcloud cf push
```

Wait a few minutes and voila! It should be running. 

 To find your app url 

```text
ibmcloud cf apps
```

You should see your app as running and also have the URL there.

From that url you can test out all the endpoints still work.
