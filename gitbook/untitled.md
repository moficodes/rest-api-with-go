This above article came out in 2012. But still pretty relevant to learn the ideology behind go.

If you are writing Rest API why should you choose go?

1. It's compiled. So you get small binaries.
2. It's fast. \(slower than c/c++ or rust\) but faster than most other web programming languages.
3. It's simple to understand.
4. It works really well in the microservices world for reason no 1.
